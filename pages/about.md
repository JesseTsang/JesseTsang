# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I have over 4 years of experience as a software developer and have worked on small and large organizations. While I consider myself a proficient full-stack developer, my interested is in building scalable back-end services (API services, Integration, and Automation).


# **Personal Interests**

My personal interests include:
* Deep learning: It's an exciting time for machine learning. I'm working through serval online classes, and swap articles with colleagues.
* Volunteering: I love sharing my passion about technology to others. I volunteer at a local community center to teach senior how to use computers.
